Manipulate me, sell me what's state-of-the-art
Cold steel replacing flesh and bone
In nothingness, I'm only the sum of my parts
I must be made anew

The void inside of my soul open wide
I'm bought and sold
Conditioned to believe that I am only what I can obtain
Solder me together and make me better

I must be made anew

Piece by piece, replace my body
Redesign me until I feel whole
Ease my soul each time I feel nothing inside

Through augmentation
They say I will be free (I will be free)
Dissolute predation
Implanted into me

Implanted into me

So empty, no identity
I can't feel anything
This obsession is killing me

Cut though blood and bone
Add to me, close me up
I've lost something from this disease
I'm more machine than me
I am not me

The endless upgrades, updates
A price tag on my fate
I'm so much better, but no better
Lost in the neon lights
Intoxicating lies

I'm a junkie chasing excess
I'm so much better, but still no better
I paid for perfection
But I still don't feel better

They say I am so much better
But I still don't feel better

Through augmentation
They say I will be free (I will be free)
Dissolute predation
Implanted into me

Implanted into me

Through augmentation
They say I will be free
They said I would be free
Dissolute predation
Implanted into me

But I don't feel free
I don't feel anything

I am not me

They said I would be free
But what left is only emptiness
